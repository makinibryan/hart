                                   Amboseli National Park is situated due south of Nairobi, Most of the park consists of
                                   a dry, ancient lake bed and
                                   fragile grassland with patches of acacia woodland, while in the southern area there
                                   is a number of small, rocky,
                                   volcanic hills. Around the swamps Ol Okenya, Ol Tukai and Enkongo Narok, the
                                   vegetation is lush with yellow barked
                                   acacias and phoenix palms.

                              <p>
                                   Rising early for good views of Mount Kilimanjaro before clouds build up over the
                                   summit with packed lunch provided, an optional visit to a Masai village can be
                                   planned after breakfast. A visit reveals the
                                   singing and dancing that are part of their daily lives and sacred rituals. A glimpse
                                   into their homes and social structure is a poignant experience. Despite its changing
                                   habitat, Amboseli National Park is
                                   possibly the best wildlife area in the whole of Africa to experience elephant at
                                   close range. Left unharassed by poachers, elephants feeding and bathing in the swamps
                                   must form the highlights of any Safari.
                                   Dinner and overnight at campsite or lodge.

                              <p>
                                   Early morning pick up, then drive to Lake Nakuru National Park. Known all over the
                                   world for its flamingoes, it's
                                   alkaline and is recognized as being one of the natural wonders of the world. Lake
                                   Nakuru is now a rhino sanctuary,
                                   harbouring a population of over 40 black and over 60 white rhinos, but the
                                   flamingoes, of course, have always been the
                                   main attraction. At times there may be almost 2 million flamingoes in the residence,
                                   forming a stunningly beautiful deep
                                   pink band around the edge of the lakeshore. Arrive in time for lunch then have an
                                   afternoon game drive.

                                   Dinner and overnight at campsite or lodge.

                              <p>
                                   An early morning drive to Lake Naivasha, it is the highest and the most beautiful of
                                   the Rif Valley lakes. At 1910m
                                   (6200f), the water is fresh and the lake is fringed with dense clumps of papyrus
                                   (ancient Egyptian once used this to
                                   make paper). Kingfishers use the papyrus as a perch, herons hide in it while
                                   searching for food. Naivasha is yet another
                                   area popular for bird watching (over 400species have been recorded). It is also a
                                   favorite weekend retreat for Nairobi
                                   residents, who come here to sail, water ski and fish. There are no crocodiles in the
                                   lake as the water is too cold for
                                   them, due to altitude but there are a number of hippos. Along the lakeshore,
                                   vineyards produce grapes for the country's
                                   fledgeling wine industry.

                                   Dinner and overnight at campsite or lodge.

                              <p>
                                   Depart early morning to Maasai Mara National Reserve, it holds on as one of the few
                                   places left on earth where wildlife
                                   still lives comparatively undisturbed, in the numbers that once roamed the plains and
                                   forests of Africa. As the northern
                                   tip of the vast Serengeti ecosystem, the Mara hosts the spectacular seasonal
                                   migration of many thousands of Wildebeest,
                                   Zebras and attendant predators. Arrive in time for lunch then have an afternoon game
                                   drive.

                                   Dinner and overnight at campsite or lodge.

                              <p>
                                   After breakfast, we have a full day dame drive, with packed lunch provided. The
                                   reserve is well known for its
                                   black-manned lion, as well as its abundant resident wildlife and its one of the few
                                   places where it's possible to see
                                   the big five during a morning's game drive. Many of the cheetahs are so tame they
                                   seek shelter from the hot sun under
                                   one's vehicle and several even climb onto the roof to get a better view of
                                   prospective prey. For the bird enthusiast,
                                   almost 500 species have been recorded: among these 16 species of eagle, plus many
                                   hawks and falcons, 6 species of
                                   vultures, 8 species of storks 4 of bustard (including the Kori bustard, the world's
                                   heaviest flying bird), and 9 species
                                   of sunbirds.

                                   Dinner and overnight at campsite or lodge.
