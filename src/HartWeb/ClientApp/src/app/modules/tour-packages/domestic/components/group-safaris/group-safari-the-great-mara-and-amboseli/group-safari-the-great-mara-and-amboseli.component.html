                                   accommodation, day spent at leisure or have an afternoon game drive. Amboseli
                                   National Park is situated due south of Nairobi,
                                   Most of the park consists of a dry, ancient lake bed and fragile grassland with
                                   patches of acacia woodland, while in the southern area there is a number of small,
                                   rocky, volcanic hills. Around the swamps
                                   Ol Kenya, Ol Tukai and Enkongo Narok, the vegetation is lush with yellow-barked
                                   acacias and phoenix palms. Dinner and overnight at campsite or lodge.

                                   summit, with packed lunch provided, an optional visit to a Maasai village can be
                                   planned after breakfast. A visit reveals
                                   the singing and dancing that are part of their daily lives and sacred rituals. A
                                   glimpse into their homes and social structure is a poignant experience. Despite its
                                   changing habitat, Amboseli National
                                   Park is possibly the best wildlife area in the whole of Africa to experience elephant
                                   at close range. Left unharassed by poachers, elephants feeding and bathing in the
                                   swamps must form the highlights of
                                   any Safari. Dinner and overnight at campsite or lodge.

                              <p>
                                   An early morning drive to Lake Naivasha, it is the highest and the most beautiful of
                                   the Rift Valley lakes. At 1910m (6200f), the water is fresh and the lake is fringed
                                   with dense clumps of papyrus
                                   (ancient Egyptian once used this to make paper). Kingfishers use the papyrus as a
                                   perch, herons hide in it while searching for food. Naivasha is yet another area
                                   popular for bird watching (over 400
                                   species have been recorded). It is also a favourite weekend retreat for Nairobi
                                   residents, who come here to sail, water ski and fish. There are no crocodiles in the
                                   lake as the water is too cold for
                                   them, due to altitude but there are a number of hippos. Along the lakeshore,
                                   vineyards produce grapes for the country's fledgeling wine industry. Dinner and
                                   overnight at campsite or lodge.

                              <p>
                                   An early morning drive to Maasai Mara National Reserve, it holds on as one of the few
                                   places left on earth where wildlife still lives comparatively undisturbed, in the
                                   numbers that once roamed the
                                   plains and forests of Africa. As the northern tip of the vast Serengeti ecosystem,
                                   the Mara hosts the spectacular seasonal migration of many thousands of Wildebeest,
                                   Zebras and attendant predators.
                                   Have lunch en-route, the evening is spent at leisure. Dinner and overnight at
                                   campsite or lodge.

                              <h4><strong>Day 5: : Explore The Great Mara </strong> </h4>
                              <p>
                                   Today we have a full day game drive, with packed lunch provided. The reserve is well
                                   known for its black-manned lion, as well as its abundant resident wildlife and its
                                   one of the few places where
                                   it's possible to see the big five during a morning's game drive. Many of the cheetahs
                                   are so tame they seek shelter from the hot sun under one's vehicle and several even
                                   climb onto the roof to get
                                   a better view of prospective prey. For the bird enthusiast, almost 500 species have
                                   been recorded: among these 16 species of eagle, plus many hawks and falcons, 6
                                   species of vultures, 8 species of
                                   storks 4 of bustard (including the Kori bustard, the world's heaviest flying bird),
                                   and 9 species of sunbirds. Dinner and overnight at campsite or lodge.
