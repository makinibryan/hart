                              <p>
                                   We start our safari by driving to Lake Bogoria. Although there's plenty of wildlife
                                   in and around Lake Bogoria, it tends to make itself scarce, with the
                                   exception of the flamingos at the hot springs. Most animals - including buffalo,
                                   hyena, klipspringer, impala, dik-dik, zebra, warthog and Grant's gazelle -
                                   prefer the remote and inaccessible eastern shore, though you may see greater kudu
                                   just about anywhere. The flamingos, for some curious reason - possibly
                                   chemical - tend to flock in their greatest numbers to the shallows on the western
                                   shore, where the hot springs flow into the lake (they appear immune to
                                   the heat). The Bogoria fish eagles have made a gruesome adjustment to their fierce,
                                   fishless environment: they prey on flamingos. Other birds to look out
                                   for include avocets, transitory pelicans and migratory steppe eagles. Dinner and
                                   overnight at campsite or lodge.

                                   Early morning pick up, then drive to Lake Nakuru National Park, across the equator,
                                   southwards of Bogoria, lies the rift valleys most famous lake Nakuru.
                                   Known all over the world for its flamingoes, it's alkaline and is recognized as being
                                   one of the natural wonders of the world. Lake Nakuru is now a rhino
                                   sanctuary, harbouring a population of over 40 black and over 60 white rhinos, but the
                                   flamingoes, of course, have always been the main attraction. At times
                                   there may be almost 2 million flamingoes in the residence, forming a stunningly
                                   beautiful deep pink band around the edge of the lake shore. Arrive in time
                                   for lunch then have an afternoon game drive. Dinner and overnight at campsite or
                                   lodge.

                                   Full days of game drive in Mara. After breakfast, we have a full day game drive, with
                                   packed lunch provided. The reserve is well known for its black-manned
                                   lion, as well as its abundant resident wildlife and its one of the few places where
                                   it's possible to see the big five during a morning's game drive. Many of
                                   the cheetahs are so tame they seek shelter from the hot sun under one's vehicle and
                                   several even climb onto the roof to get a better view of prospective prey.
                                   For the bird enthusiast, almost 500 species have been recorded: among these 16
                                   species of eagle, plus many hawks and falcons, 6 species of vultures, 8 species
                                   of storks 4 of bustard (including the Kori bustard, the world's heaviest flying
                                   bird), and 9 species of sunbirds. Dinner and overnight at campsite or lodge.
